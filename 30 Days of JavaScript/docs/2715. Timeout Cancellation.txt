Given a function fn, an array of arguments args, and a timeout t in milliseconds, return a cancel function cancelFn.

After a delay of cancelT, the returned cancel function cancelFn will be invoked.

setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelT)
Initially, the execution of the function fn should be delayed by t milliseconds.

If, before the delay of t milliseconds, the function cancelFn is invoked, it should cancel the delayed execution of fn. Otherwise, if cancelFn is not invoked within the specified delay t, fn should be executed with the provided args as arguments.

 

Example 1:

Input: fn = (x) => x * 5, args = [2], t = 20
Output: [{"time": 20, "returned": 10}]
Explanation: 
const cancelT = 50;
const result = [];

const fn = (x) => x * 5;

const start = performance.now();

const log = (...argsArr) => {
    const diff = Math.floor(performance.now() - start);
    result.push({"time": diff, "returned": fn(...argsArr)});
}
     
const cancel = cancellable(log, [2], 20);

const maxT = Math.max(t, 50);
          
setTimeout(cancel, cancelT);

setTimeout(() => {
     console.log(result); // [{"time":20,"returned":10}]
}, 65);

The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelT (50ms), which happened after the execution of fn(2) at 20ms.
Example 2:

Input: fn = (x) => x**2, args = [2], t = 100
Output: []
Explanation: 
const cancelT = 50;
The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelT (50ms), which happened before the execution of fn(2) at 100ms, resulting in fn(2) never being called.
Example 3:

Input: fn = (x1, x2) => x1 * x2, args = [2,4], t = 30
Output: [{"time": 30, "returned": 8}]
Explanation: 
const cancelT = 100;
The cancellation was scheduled to occur after a delay of cancelT (100ms), which happened after the execution of fn(2,4) at 30ms.
